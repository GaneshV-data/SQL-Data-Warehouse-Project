### Data Warehouse and Analytics Project

Welcome to the Data Warehouse and Analytics Project repository! 🚀
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data warehousing and analytics solution—from building a data warehouse to generating actionable insights. Designed as a portfolio project, it highlights industry best practices in data engineering and analytics.

### 🏗️ Data Architecture

This project follows the Medallion Architecture using Bronze, Silver, and Gold layers:

Bronze Layer: Stores raw data as-is from the source systems. Data is ingested from CSV files into SQL Server Database.

Silver Layer: Performs data cleansing, standardization, and normalization to prepare the data for analysis.

Gold Layer: Stores business-ready data modeled into a star schema for reporting and analytics.

###  📖 Project Overview

Data Architecture: Designing a modern data warehouse using the Medallion Architecture.

ETL Pipelines: Extracting, transforming, and loading data from source systems into the warehouse.

Data Modeling: Creating fact and dimension tables optimized for analytical queries.

Analytics & Reporting: Developing SQL-based insights and dashboards.
